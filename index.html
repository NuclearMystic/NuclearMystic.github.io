        <p>Currently enrolled at Oakland Community college working towards my associates degree in computer information systems. After that,
            I plan on going to University of Michigan for a bachlors in computer science, then hopefully a masters. I have a passion for learning and 
            always strive to push myself to new heights, considering myself a perpetual work in progress. I am competent with C#, Java, SQL, HTML, and will soon be
            learning Pyton, and C++. I have worked mostly with the Unity game engine, Blender, and GIMP, with a desire to learn Unreal engine, GODOT, and
            one day I hope to build my own game engine.
        </p>

            I have yet to work for any game companies, but have collaborated with different groups of indie devolpers I met on Itch.io. I have also
            participated in multiple game jams on my own, and did quite well. I have been playing video games since I was a kid, and have been a huge
            computer nerd for as long as I can remember. I catch on to new software easily, and have a good understanding of how computers function
            at the hardware level as well. While I can do some 3D modeling, texturing, and animating, my true passion is coding. I love breathing life
            into art and solving problems, so programming is where I truly belong.
        </p><p>
            Here you will find all the projects I have worked on and completed, and some that are in progress. Thank you for taking the time to 
            check out my portfolio, I do hope you will enjoy what you see.
