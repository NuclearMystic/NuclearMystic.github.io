        <h2>Night Shift Nightmare</h2>
        <div class="game-summary">
            <p>Night Shift Nightmare is the biggest and most advanced game I have worked on so far, and it's also the first game I've colaborated with other designers on.
                Night Shift Nightmare is a first person horror game, with story elements that change the outcome of what happens to the player based on their actions. The 
                game is about a lone night security guard at a shady warehouse on the outskirts of town who has a habit of falling asleep on the job between patrols. 
                Eventually strange things start to happen until you find yourself face to face with a horrifying creature.

            <h3>My roles in the project:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>-Lead programmer. All code in game is made from scratch by me.</li>
                <li>-Level design. While I did not make the models themselves, I am responsible for setting them up in the scenes.</li>
                <li>-Lighting and occlusion. The game is designed to take advantage of culling objects that are not directly in the players view.</li>
                <li>-Cutscenes, dialogue, and events. While I did not write a bulk of the lines, and events in the game, I did setup and direct them, and create 
                     all the triggers for how they should proceed.
